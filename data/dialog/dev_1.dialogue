Dev: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], this is some dialogue.
Dev: Here are some choices.
- First one- Test State
	Voidmoose: You picked the first one.
	Voidmoose: Here is a value set in our state\: {{DataManager.dialogue_state.test_key}}
	Voidmoose: Now lets set a value. The value right now is\: {{DataManager.dialogue_state.test_int}}
	Voidmoose: I am adding 1 to it.
	set DataManager.dialogue_state.test_int += 1
	Voidmoose: The value is now\: {{DataManager.dialogue_state.test_int}}
- Second one- Test Logic
	Valaris: You picked the second one.
	Valaris: Now let's test some logic. 
	if DataManager.dialogue_state.test_int > 0
		Valaris: You ran through the first test. Good job. 
		Valaris: You should not see this if you did not run through first test.
	else
		Valaris: You did not run through the first test. 
		Valaris: If you did, and you are seeing this, logic test is failing
	Valaris: That ends the logic test. 
- Start again => dev_testing
- End the conversation => END
Voidmoose: Don't you feel so special.
Valaris: As one should.
Dev: I might as well chime in too.
